# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 14

Lab today will be a practice run in working with your project team. You're going to create a single project (in a new GitHub repo, of course, and call it `dec_01_lab`, with all team members set up as Collaborators) with two HTML docs and supporting CSS and JS docs as needed.

Pro tip: Keep notes on your progress throughout the lab and record any "a ha" moments.

***It is not expected that you will complete this project in any meaningful way. The point of this exercise is to get your feet wet in the group work process and to try some things for the first time without the pressure of working on your final project.***

***Also, consider how far you made it relative to what you thought you would. Then turn in the project and go home and start collecting your thoughts on the final project.***

***Do not work on this all night to try to make it perfect. Just don't. You're not going to be graded on how well today's pages came out. Seriously, do not work on this outside of the group exercise today. You're going to be evaluated on how the group work went rather than the code itself.***

***There are instructions in an exercise below that you should follow to create merge conflicts. You need practice in seeing those and resolving those.***

***Focus more on process than product, but still build the best thing you can. The more Git you do, the better. A-C often, and P occasionally. Don't forget PRs when wanting to merge to master.***

***The other big goal of this assignment is to give something clear to build out as a team, and to see how far you make it in the time you spend on it. Calibrating your sense of "It takes this long to do X" is an important part of planning and completing a project***

## Today's buildout

1. One of the HTML docs is a design comp based on the PREVIEW.tiff image in the adjoining assets directory.

2. The other HTML doc will be a metric/standard conversion calculator. How you design it and implement it is up to you. Here are the technical requirements:
	- Capable of doing the following conversions:
  		- inches to/from centimeters
  		- fluid ounces to/from milliliters
  		- miles to/from kilometers
  		- pounds to/from kilograms
  		- English shit-ton to metric shit-ton
		- Receives user input via a single \<input> element, has a \<select> element to determine the conversion, and has a \<button> for users to click to perform the conversion
		- The result is displayed in the browser window in this format: "1 inch equals 2.540 centimeters"
		- Round decimals to the thousandths place as in example
		- Maintain a list of all conversions performed on the window, and give user an option to clear the list
		- Other than that, make that conversion page whatever you want.

3. Each page should have a clear link to the other HTML document

There are no requirements about how each team member contributes, or what your workflow is, such as there is on the final project, but each team member should keep a log of the parts that they work on, and in what role/capacity, for submission in Canvas at the end of the day.
