### Go over the assigned readings

**Article on Domain Modeling (Sobol)**

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
- Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models:
  - When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
  - Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
  - Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
  - Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
  - Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
  - Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
